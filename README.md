# 🧠 Splunk SIEM Home Lab – Detecting Failed Logins

## 📌 Project Overview
This home lab simulates a real-world SIEM setup using **Splunk** to detect and alert on **failed login attempts**. I generated custom log data and used dashboards to visualize suspicious behavior, demonstrating basic detection engineering and log analysis skills.

---

 Tools Used
- 🖥️ **Splunk** (Free version, installed locally)
- 🪟 **Windows 10 VM** (Simulated attacker machine)
- ⚙️ **Manual data upload or log ingestion** (via Splunk web UI)
- 📦 **VirtualBox** (for virtual machine management)

---

 What I Did
1. Installed and configured Splunk in a virtual environment
2. Simulated multiple failed login attempts on a Windows VM
3. Uploaded or ingested logs into Splunk
4. Used Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) to find failed login events
5. Built a dashboard to visualize login failure patterns
6. Analyzed log entries to identify login behavior and potential brute force attempts
